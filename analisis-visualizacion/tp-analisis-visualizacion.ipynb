En particular, no tenía ninguna columna target y estaba bien balanceado entre todos los puntajes del 1 al 5. No fue posible encontrar correlaciones llamativas entre las clases de datos con los que contábamos, aunque una hipótesis posible inicial fue imaginarse si había alguna relación entre el largo de una review y el puntaje que se le dio al producto. Rápidamente se pudo descartar esta teoría calculando un par de estadísticos y no se pudo determinar que una review larga indicara un puntaje alto o bajo, ni viceversa (una review corta tampoco iría necesariamente de la mano con un puntaje particularmente alto o bajo)."
